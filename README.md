### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I don't have much here but feel free to peruse. Most of my repositories are from various Hack-A-Thons - some cool, some not - and some personal projects of mine. 

#### In this specific repository, I also house some setting/configration files for some commonly used programs/shells, feel free to copy/modify/use any of these setting files.
